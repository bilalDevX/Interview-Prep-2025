## 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods). These objects interact with each other to build software systems. OOP promotes code reusability, scalability, and maintainability and is widely used in languages like Python, Java, and C++.

## 2. Why OOP?
OOP provides modularity, code reusability, and scalability, making it easier to develop and maintain large applications. It improves security through encapsulation, reduces code duplication with inheritance, enhances flexibility via polymorphism, and helps manage complex systems efficiently. This is why OOP is the preferred approach in modern software development.

## 3. . What is the Concept of a Class?
A class is a blueprint for creating objects in OOP. It defines attributes (data) and methods (behavior) that its objects will have. It helps in code reusability and organization by grouping related functionalities together."
