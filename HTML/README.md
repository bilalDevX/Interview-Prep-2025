# Html Questions For My Interview Prepration

## 1. What are sementic HTML elements? Why they are important? 
```
Semantic elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`, and `<section>` provide meaning and structure to web content. They improve SEO, accessibility, and code readability.
```
## 2. Difference between `<div>` and `<section>`? also `<span>`
```
- `<div>` is a block-level, non-semantic container that takes full width. It is mainly used for styling and layout purposes but has no inherent meaning.  

- `<section>` is a block-level semantic element that takes full width. It is used to group related content meaningfully, improving SEO and accessibility.  

- `<span>` is an inline element that doesn’t take full width; it only occupies the space of its content. It is used inside block elements for styling without affecting the layout.  
```

## 3. What is the difference between `<em>` and `<strong>`?  
```
- **`<em>` (emphasis):** An inline element that italicizes text and gives it semantic importance for screen readers. 

- **`<strong>` (strong emphasis):** An inline element that bolds text and conveys higher importance for SEO and accessibility.  
```
## 4. Difference Between `<strong>` and `<b>`.
```
- **`<strong>`:** Bold text with semantic meaning, indicating importance. Screen readers emphasize it, and it helps SEO.
- **`<b>`:** Bold text without semantic meaning, used only for visual styling. Screen readers ignore it, and it does not affect SEO.
```
